                <h2>Enhanced Learning Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        AR and VR can provide an immersive and interactive learning experience  that can increase engagement and retention of information. Research and  experiment showed that "VR to help students learn valuable technical    and vocational skills."(Pauleth Ip) It's a great point to concern since  there is a critical problem within the traditional classroom. For instance, in physics class, it might be better for teacher to visualize  a 3D objects with VR technology rather than drawing on a whiteboard.

                <h2>Personalized Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to make a teaching lesson effective, is to get students truly invovled with the class. Not just listening teacher's lecture, watching explanation video, and reading the textbook. There must be some activity that acquire students to do something in class. According to Frontiers' researchers, "The development of virtual experiences in science teaching should be designed to enhance student learning and motivate positive attitudes in students.". In their projects, they found around 82 - 97%  of students comitted that VR/AR "helped them better understand the vector concepts in the class, such as the three-dimensional vectors, visualization of the angles, and components of vectors."(Frontiers' researcher)

                    According to Frontier's researchers, "Visualization as the most basic learning objective and understanding as the highest." If students really wants to understand a topic through sight, the visualization must be clear.

                 <h2>Buget Issue</h2>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to getting a new technology, it acquire a really high budget. Some school may argue that getting a VR/AR for every students would be a high cost. A school really needs to evaluate carefully when the cost is high, but this can be a great investment. The main reason makes this payment worthy is that it's really engaging. According to a tech company from Avanti at ClassVR, technology like Augmented Reality(AR) provides "a better interaction and communication". It allows students to "explore, create and collaborate with their peers."(Avanti) Schools like Emmanuel College from Australia has promote this for teachers to "interaction by getting students to create incredible buildings in Minecraft, then collaboratively exploring their creations in augmented reality using ClassVR headsets."(Avanti).

                 <h2>Distraction, Video Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many people especially parents might think this technology is a distraction as it has a high popularity in the use of video game too, leading them to believe it's a distraction instead of educating tool, but that won't be case if they use it properly. Morever, the use of AR/VR in education is more than they think. Pauleth Ip from Adorma calculate that over 97% of students are excited to take course with VR base on The App Solutions Reports. Base on the statistic, it seems only 41% of uses VR came from education while video game was around 72%. However, it's a statistic from 2018, todays, it can be higher in education category as more people gain access to VR/AR technology.

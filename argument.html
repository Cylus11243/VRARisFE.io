                <h2>Enhanced Learning Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        AR and VR can provide an immersive and interactive learning experience  that can increase engagement and retention of information. Research and  experiment showed that "VR to help students learn valuable technical    and vocational skills."(Pauleth Ip) It's a great point to concern since  there is a critical problem within the traditional classroom. For instance, in physics class, it might be better for teacher to visualize  a 3D objects with VR technology rather than drawing on a whiteboard.

                <h2>Personalized Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to make a teaching lesson effective, is to get students truly invovled with the class. Not just listening teacher's lecture, watching explanation video, and reading the textbook. There must be some activity that acquire students to do something in class. According to Frontiers' researchers, "The development of virtual experiences in science teaching should be designed to enhance student learning and motivate positive attitudes in students.". In their projects, they found around 82 - 97%  of students comitted that VR/AR "helped them better understand the vector concepts in the class, such as the three-dimensional vectors, visualization of the angles, and components of vectors."(Frontiers' researcher)

                    <p>
                        When it comes to getting a new technology, it acquire a really high budget. Some school may argue that getting a VR/AR for every students would be a high cost.

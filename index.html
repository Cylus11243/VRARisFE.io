                        <h3>Visualization</h3>
                        <p>
                            It's greatly used in university courses. For instance, an introductory physics class that needs to visualize the shape to teach students 3D vectors. This study shows that students who used VR performed better than those who didn't, especially when it comes to a question that needs to be visualized. The study proves that college's student have better performance with new technology than traditional methods.

                        <p>
                            Augmented reality on learning and cognitive load in university-level physics laboratory courses. The data shows that augmented reality(AR) systems can be helpful in many ways. Such as the AR smart glasses, the team compares using the glasses and without it to see whether it makes it easier for students to learn when using AR technology.
